# Particle-Swarm-Optimization-for-Simple-Function
This is a simple example where the algorithm finds three numbers that add up to a target value. A fully connected neighborhood is used, so all particles can be compared to each other.  Find three operands that add up to 50. Ten particles. V_MAX = 10
